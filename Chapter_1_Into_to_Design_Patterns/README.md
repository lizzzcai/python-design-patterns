# Chapter 1: Intro to Design Patterns


# Design Principle

1. Identity the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that donâ€™t.


2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
