# Chapter 1: Intro to Design Patterns

## OO Basics

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

## Design Principle

1. Enapsulate what varies.
2. Favor composition over inheritance.
3. Program to interfaces, not implementations.

## The Strategy Pattern

The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeale. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## The power of a shared pattern vocabulary

When you comunicate using patterns you are doing more than just sharing LIGO.

1. Shared pattern vocabuaries are POWERFUL.
2. Patterns allow you to say more with less.
3. Talking at the pattern level allows you to stay "in the design" longer.
4. Shared vocabularies can turbo charge your development team.
5. Shared vocabularies encourage more junior developers to get up to speed.

## How do I use Design Patterns

Design patterns don’t go directly into your code, they fi rst go into your BRAIN. Once you’ve loaded your brain with a good working knowledge of patterns, you can then start to apply them to your new designs, and rework your old code when you fi nd it’s degrading into an infl exible mess of jungle spaghetti code.

## BULLET POINTS

* Knowing the OO basics does not make you a good OO designer.
* Good OO designs are reusable, extensible and maintainable.
* Patterns show you how to build systems with good OO design qualities.
* Patterns are proven objectoriented experience.
* Patterns don’t give you code, they give you general solutions to design problems. You apply them to your specific application.
* Patterns aren’t invented, they are discovered.
* Most patterns and principles address issues of change in software.
* Most patterns allow some part of a system to vary independently of all other parts.
* We often try to take what varies in a system and encapsulate it.
* Patterns provide a shared language that can maximize the value of your communication with other developers.
